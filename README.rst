Through experimentation, math and, of course, Python, we will do science! We
will explore the symbolic calculus, the numeric and even the machine learning
field.

The goal is to measure the terrestrial gravity and validate the equations of
the uniformly accelerated motion.


Setup
=====

Use `Pipenv <https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/>`__ to setup your virtual
environment and install all the required dependencies::

   pipenv sync

Then run Jupyter notebook with::

   pipenv run jupyter notebook


Binder
======

Alternatively, if you do not want to setup a virtual environment, you may want
to `try Binder
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Peque/PyConES-Spain-2018-eureka/binder?filepath=Eureka.ipynb>`__
to run the notebook and visualize the results.
